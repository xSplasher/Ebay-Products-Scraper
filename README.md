give this script an ebay category link (or a subcategory) and it will scrape all products that were sold within it.

the output is a csv file containing these columns: Product Title, Price, Sold (how many times it was sold), Product link

You can run the code on your local machine but eBay will temporarily ban your ip address, to avoid that use the google colab i made.
the only downside to this is that google colab will "turn off" after 8hours, so if you're scraping a link make sure it doesnt take more than that.

this script is very useful if you're doing product research or you if want to know what are the best selling products in a category.
